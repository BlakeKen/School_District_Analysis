# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to compare school reading and math grades by size of school, budget etc. By doing this the school district could determine how they wanted to go about things for the next school year to maximize student success.

The grades at Thomas High School were tampered with for the 9th grade. The purpose of the challenge was to remove those grades and perform the updated analysis.
